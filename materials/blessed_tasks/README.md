Each material contains multiple computations for different purposes. Each computation is referred to as a "task". This field contains a dictionary of all the tasks performed on this material and their associated task_ids. An example would be:

{'GGA Uniform v2': 'mp-882394', 
'GGA band structure v2': 'mp-885182', 
'GGA+U Uniform v2': 'mp-797269', 
'GGA+U band structure v2': 'mp-797820', 
'GGA+U optimize structure (2x)': 'mp-19017'}
