The task_id for the material. It is also the materials id used in the Materials Project.

As of this writing, the task\_id is a (semi-systematically) chosen entry from the task\_ids (plural) array - i.e., task\_id is a member of task\_ids. In the future, it is planned to divorce the task\_id from this and use the snlgroup\_id, which is a better representation of a materials id.
